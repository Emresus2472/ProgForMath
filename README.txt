In Reversi, a valid move captures at least one of the opponent's disks. This is achieved by "flipping" a line of the opponent's disks between the newly placed disk and another disk of the current player's color. The move validation algorithm, implemented in the “possible moves” method, scans the entire board to identify valid moves for the current player. For each disk belonging to the player, the algorithm checks in eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals). Suppose a neighboring cell contains an opponent's disk. In that case, the algorithm continues in that direction to see if it eventually encounters an empty cell, marking it as a potential move or another disk of the current player's color, which confirms the validity of the move. This process ensures that all possible moves are identified and stored in a list.    Once a valid move is made, the disks affected by the move need to be flipped. The flipping process is handled by the flipping method, which examines the eight possible directions from the newly placed disk. For each direction, it collects the opponent's disks until it encounters a disk of the current player's color. If such a disk is found, all collected opponent disks are flipped to the player's color. This algorithm ensures that the board state is updated correctly after every move, reflecting the strategic impact of the player's actions.
